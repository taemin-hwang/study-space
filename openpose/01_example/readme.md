## How to get distance between user and depth-camera
Openpose can detect body part locations (x, y) and detection confidence, and also Intel Realsense D435 can support to measure distance from camera. With these functions, this code provide a distance between a user and Intel Realsense depth camera.

### Prerequisite
* Openpose
* Pyrealsense


### Run
```$ python 01_get_user_distance_from_realsense.py ```


### Result
```
Distance : 1.13100004196167 (m)
Distance : 1.13100004196167 (m)
Distance : 1.13200008869171 (m)
Distance : 1.13300001621246 (m)
Distance : 1.13800001144409 (m)
Distance : 1.13500010967254 (m)
Distance : 1.13600003719329 (m)
